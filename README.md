**Research on Text Data Augmentation Methods for Low-Quality Text Based on LLMs**    
Objective: Leverage LLMs to improve the quality and diversity of training data to optimize the performance of
machine learning and deep learning models, especially when data quality is low or data volume is insufficient.  
### Core Contents in this repo:
- Prompt engineering and data augmentation;
- Model training and fine-tuning: Conducted comparative experiments and performance analysis on
traditional deep learning models and pre-trained models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and Electra) using the
processed augmented data.
